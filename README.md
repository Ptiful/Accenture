# Accenture
Accenture asked us to manipulate datas they sent so we could answer some questions for them as :
- 'What categories/subcategories are projected to grow the fastest in the next 5 years?'
- 'Within there Categories/Subcategories, what Channels are growing ?'
- 'What is Dragonyte's market position within these fast-growing categories ?'
- 'Provide predictions and explanation of the model used'
- 'Give your recommendations to the Dargonyte Board'.

## To run
Run 'main.py' to clean all csvs files. 
This will automatically move files from the data_old folder to data_new folder.

### Tools
Pandas, Tableau, Python 3.10 or higher.
