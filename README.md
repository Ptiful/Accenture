# Data visualization business case - Dragonyte Brewery
This repository holds a data visualization exercise completed as business case workshop created by Accenture Belgium. The students are tasked to explore and treat a dataset about drinks sales and regional exposures of a mock brewing company - Dragonyte Brewery. The results of the workshop were computed into a Tableau dashboard, and presented as recommandations to a mock strategic board.

# Description of the task
Accenture tasks the group to manipulate data they provide, and then answer the following questions :
- 'What categories/subcategories are projected to grow the fastest in the next 5 years?'
- 'Within there Categories/Subcategories, what Channels are growing ?'
- 'What is Dragonyte's market position within these fast-growing categories ?'
- 'Provide predictions and explanation of the model used'
- 'Give your recommendations to the Dragonyte Board'.

## To run
Run 'main.py' to clean all .csv's files. 
This will automatically move files from the data_old folder to data_new folder.
Those .csv's are now properly formated and can be imported into Tableau.
### Tools
Pandas, Tableau, Python 3.10 or higher.
